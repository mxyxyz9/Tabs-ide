# Tabs

Tabs is a desktop-first workspace for coding agents.

It combines:

- a React web app for chat, project state, browser tools, terminal tools, and workspace controls
- a local Node/WebSocket server that brokers provider runtimes such as Codex and Claude
- an Electron shell that can host the app, embedded terminals, browser surfaces, and a local VS Code-based workbench inside the Code tab

## What the project contains

- `apps/web`
  The main Tabs frontend.
- `apps/server`
  The local server that owns settings, orchestration, provider runtime integration, git helpers, terminal sessions, and IPC-facing APIs.
- `apps/desktop`
  The Electron desktop shell.
- `packages/contracts`
  Shared runtime contracts and schemas.
- `packages/shared`
  Shared utilities used across the app.

## Core features

- provider-backed agent threads
- project-aware chat and workspace state
- embedded browser tooling
- embedded terminal tooling
- project-specific custom browser tabs and terminal tabs
- git and server controls inside the workspace shell
- desktop app with an embedded Code tab powered by a local VS Code build
- Tailscale status monitoring & network connection options
- Source control / Git credentials configuration
- Multi-provider model configuration picker in settings

## Prerequisites

You need:

- `bun` 1.3+
- `node` 24+
- a working Codex CLI install if you want Codex-backed threads
- a working Claude CLI / agent install if you want Claude-backed threads

## Install dependencies

From the repo root:

```bash
bun install
```

## Run the web app and local server in development

From the repo root:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Useful variants:

```bash
bun run dev:web
bun run dev:server
bun run dev:desktop
```

## Run the desktop app

From the repo root:

```bash
bun run dev:desktop
```

For a packaged-start style local run:

```bash
bun run start:desktop
```

## Embedded Code tab setup

The desktop Code tab prefers a sibling VS Code checkout that has already been compiled for the Electron workbench.

Tabs now expects that checkout at:

```bash
../tabs-code-main
```

Build it like this:

```bash
cd ../tabs-code-main
npm install
npm run compile
```

Tabs will auto-detect `../tabs-code-main` and expects these compiled assets:

- `out/vs/base/parts/sandbox/electron-browser/preload.js`
- `out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html`
- `out-build/nls.messages.json`

You can also override detection with:

- `TABS_CODE_OSS_BUILD_DIR`
  Absolute path to the local `tabs-code-main` checkout root
- `TABS_CODE_OSS_ENTRY`
  `http://` or `https://` URL for a served workbench if you explicitly want web-hosted workbench mode

## Workspace folder layout expected by this repo

A typical local layout now looks like:

```text
tabs/
  logo/
  tabs-main/
  tabs-code-main/
  tabs-code-web/
```

`tabs-code-web` is the renamed companion web checkout folder in the workspace. Tabs itself does not rely on that sibling name for the desktop Code tab boot path the way it does for `tabs-code-main`, but keeping the naming consistent helps local development.

## Typecheck

From the repo root:

```bash
bun typecheck
```

## Tests

From the repo root:

```bash
bun test
```

You can also run package-specific checks as needed.

## Build

From the repo root:

```bash
bun run build
```

## Notes

- This project is still under active development.
- Some areas still reflect upstream VS Code internals because the desktop Code tab is built on top of a local VS Code workbench checkout.
- Internal VS Code protocol names such as `vscode-webview` are expected and should not be treated as Tabs branding issues.
